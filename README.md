## Overview
 This project analyzes various economic indicators of India over a specified timeframe.
 The goal is to understand trends and patterns in India's economic performance based on key indicators such as GDP, inflation, population, and life expectancy.


## Dataset

The dataset used for analysis includes the following economic indicators for India:

- GDP (current US$)
- GDP per capita (current US$)
- GDP growth (annual %)
- Imports of goods and services (% of GDP)
- Exports of goods and services (% of GDP)
- Total reserves (includes gold, current US$)
- Inflation, consumer prices (annual %)
- Population, total
- Population growth (annual %)
- Life expectancy at birth, total (years)

The data spans multiple years and provides insights into how these indicators have evolved over time.

## Project Structure

- **Data Analysis**: Jupyter notebooks (`INDIAN ECONOMY ANALYSIS.ipynb`) are used for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis.
- **Metadata**: The repository includes a metadata file (`META DATA.md`) detailing each column in the dataset.
- **Results**: Findings and visualizations are documented within the notebooks and summarized in the README.
- **Visualization**: Histograms, box plots, and trend charts are utilized to illustrate key insights.

## Analysis Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensure data consistency and handle missing values where applicable.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify trends, outliers, and correlations among variables.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate descriptive statistics and perform trend analysis over different time periods.
4. **Insights and Conclusions**: Summarize key findings related to economic growth, demographic changes, and policy implications.
